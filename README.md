# Kestrel Chromium

Kestrel Chromium is the Chromium-engine build of the Kestrel macOS browser. It embeds the Chrome-style Chromium runtime through [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/) and [CefSwift](https://github.com/Rajaniraiyn/CefSwift); web pages are rendered by Chromium, not `WKWebView`.

The app carries over Kestrel's SwiftUI browser, tabs and split view, assistant and provider integrations, bounded page operator, local profile fill, MCP server, bookmarks, settings, updater, and optional Codex host. Chromium backs each tab and the extension manager. The built-in `chrome://extensions` page uses Chromium's own runtime. Kestrel Settings can review and import Manifest V3 extension folders, ZIP archives, and CRX packages; approved extensions load when Kestrel starts.

The Chromium build keeps its own browser profile. Cookies and history from a WebKit build are not migrated. Assistant and app settings continue to use Kestrel's existing local settings and Keychain stores.

## Port status

This is a full application port, but the CEF runtime has not yet received visible macOS acceptance. CEF's Chrome-style browser is hosted in a child window over Kestrel's page area; the overlay arrangement, site permission prompts, downloads, passkeys, and extension action popups need on-device inspection.

One material difference remains in page automation: CefSwift exposes JavaScript execution in the page's main world. Kestrel's CEF operator keeps its fixed scripts, bounded data, action allow-list, approvals, and revalidation, but does not retain WebKit's isolated JavaScript world. Do not treat that as equivalent isolation or use model-supplied JavaScript/selectors.

## Build on macOS

Requirements: macOS 14 or later, Xcode 16 or later, Swift 6, and an internet connection for the pinned CEF package and binary download.

```sh
./build.sh
open build/Kestrel.app
```

Use `./build.sh debug` for a debug configuration. CEF's helper processes use Chromium's sandbox. The generated app is ad-hoc signed for local development; it is not notarized for distribution.

The `macos-26` GitHub Actions workflow builds pull requests and can be run manually. It reports the runner's macOS/Xcode versions and uploads a zipped `Kestrel.app` artifact plus the build log. It compiles and packages the app; it does not launch the app or claim browser acceptance.

## CEF dependency and licensing

The package pins [CefSwift](https://github.com/Rajaniraiyn/CefSwift) at commit `b18cceef8afaf6686147e19a9239f31c2dd81541`, which pins the CEF and Chromium build used by this app. `build.sh` creates the required framework and helper-app layout, adds Kestrel's macOS browser permission descriptions and URL handling, and packages the CEF and CefSwift notices in `Kestrel.app/Contents/Resources`. A Codex runtime is included only when a developer explicitly supplies the pinned official executable with `KESTREL_CODEX_EXECUTABLE`.

## Source layout

- `KestrelChromium/` — CEF-backed app entry point, browser stores, operator, extension host, and Chromium bridge.
- `KestrelWebKit/` — shared Kestrel UI and engine-independent assistant/settings code, plus retained WebKit reference implementations.
- `Package.swift` — builds the `Kestrel` CEF app product and platform-neutral package tests.
- `build.sh` — bundles the CEF product as a runnable macOS app.
- `.github/workflows/macos-chromium-build.yml` — hosted macOS app build and artifact upload.
